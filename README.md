## What is it?
Zagreb university of applied science (TVZ) logo made to look like christmas tree ornament. Powered by either 2xAAA or 1xCoincell batteries. LEDs are self-flashing, mixed with slow and fast models. LEDs draw only 1-2 mA for coincell version and 3-5mA for 2xAAA battery version so expect a long battery life.

There are a lot of different designs available.
